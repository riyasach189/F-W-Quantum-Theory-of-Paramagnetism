# Description

For the Poster Day component of the course Fields and Waves, we prepared a presentation on the topic **Quantum Theory of Paramagnetism**.

## Presentation Summary

- We explained the motivation behind studying quantum theory of magnetism as opposed to classical theory.
- We solved the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for an electron in a uniform time-invariant magnetic field to obtain the expression for its total energy, and consequently paramagnetic and diamagnetic moments.
- We used Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distribution to find the magnetization of the bulk of a material.
